Yes, dogs also love to snuggle to some good movies and shows. 
So I decided to create "Petflix" -
A place where a dog can enjoy some good comedy, a cat can view some drama, and a hampster can.. well, run a wheel while watching a cartoon.

So here it is, tell all the pets you know - now they have Petflix.
